# Coding-Exercise-Simple-Poker-Hands-2
The task is to create an algorithm that takes five playing cards as its input and outputs the resulting poker hand. Cards have four suits (clubs, spades, hearts, diamonds) and rank from 2 to Ace. As for the hands themselves, any poker website will help you. This kata is interesting because it makes us think about ways to break down a problem, to structure our code and to always look for "the simplest thing that could possibly work".  Based on definition of poker hands from Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_poker_hands
